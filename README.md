# Hike Plan

You've just been on the worst hike of your life, but you've learned a lot about
how to make the next one better and it's time to start planning. Build a commit
containing the items you want to bring with you.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your computer and navigate to it using your terminal
2. Run `./start` in your terminal to begin the game.
3. Using files from the `shelter`, `food`, and `clothes` branches, build a
   single commit containing:
   - 1 shelter option
   - 2 food options
   - 3 clothing options, 1 of which must be hiking books
4. Run `./finish` in your terminal to check your work!

If you make a mistake, run `./start` to start over.

## Tips

### Exploring Commits

- See which branches are available with `git branch`
- Switch branches with `git switch branch-name-here`, such as `git switch food`.
- Navigate back to your previous branch with `git switch -`

### Getting Files From Other Branches

To copy a file or folder from another branch:

1. Switch to the **destination** branch
2. Run `git checkout source-branch-name-here file-or-folder-to-copy`. For
   example, `git checkout food food/trail-mix` copies the file `food/trail-mix`
   from the `food` branch into your current branch.

Use tab completion to help with spelling!
